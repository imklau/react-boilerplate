## 🚀 Quick start

Make sure you have node +12 and npm +7 installed and then run:

```
npx @imklau/react-app <app-name>
```

If you want to use **React & TypeScript** template run it with the `-ts` flag:

```
npx @imklau/react-app <app-name> -ts
```

## 👩🏻‍💻 Available commands:

- `yarn start` - runs the app in the development mode. (`localhost:9000` by default)
- `yarn build` - builds the app for production, files are saved to the `public` folder
- `yarn build:serve` - builds the app and starts a server which will serve your build files
- `yarn lint` - runs eslint to check all your js/ts files in the `src` directory
- `yarn format` - runs prettier to format all your js/ts files in the `src` directory
